                <h2>1891</h2>
                <p>The first slot machine was invented by Sittman and Pitt in Brooklyn, New York. 
                    It was a poker machine that had 5 drums with 50 playing cards. The machine was popular in bars and saloons, but it did not pay out money.
                    Instead, players would win prizes like free drinks or cigars.</p>
