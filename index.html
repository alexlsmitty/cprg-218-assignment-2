                <p>The first slot machine was invented by Sittman and Pitt in Brooklyn, New York. 
                Players would hope to form a hand of poker after putting in a nickel and pulling the lever, with prizes
            tending to be cigars or free drinks due to prohibitions on gambling.</p>

                <h2>1895</h2>
                <p>Charles Fey, a Bavarian-born mechanic based in San Fransisco is credited for inventing the first true "slot machine."
                    Players would insert a coin, pull a lever, and hope to match three symbols to win a prize. Automatic payout was a novel feature, and
                    contributed greatly to the popularity of the machine.

                <p>Bally Technologies introduced the first electromechanical slot machine called Money Honey.

                    The machine was a huge success and paved the way for the hallmarks of modern slot machines, like bonus rounds and free spins.</p>
